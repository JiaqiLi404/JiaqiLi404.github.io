<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm Jiaqi Li, a graduate student pursuing an Master of science degree in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong.

I was majored in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science as an undergraduate, participated in 4 national AI competitions and won the second prize in the National College Mathematical Modeling Contest, during which period my groupmates and I studied over 100 papers and completed 20 machine learning related projects with more than 20,000 lines of code. 

My recent interests lies on deep learning, computer vision, transfer learning, generative model, self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and multi-model fusion. I am looking for a PhD opportunity in deep learning and willing to devote myself into new fields. As the first author, I have completed <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ru2ps-0AAAAJ'><strong><span id='total_cit'>4</span></strong> papers </a>with team members while one SCI paper is under review, which is about Time Series Clustering using the DTW distance. In the meanwhile, I have 3 patents and 4 software copyrights.

You can also get my CV <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-jXP9oqiqYmgW3ODOyw7qs5Zhvn28TEK/view?usp=share_link'>here</a>.

[**Hot Topics Clustering based on Gaussian Mixture Model with built-in DTW**](https://github.com/JiaqiLi404/gmm_dtw)

**Jiaqi Li**, Chenggang Lu, Qingyue Wang

[**Project**](https://github.com/JiaqiLi404/gmm_dtw) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data=''></span></strong>
- Time series clustering algorithms, like K-Shape and DTW-KMeans, have accuracy gap in many datasets. However, combining the DTW with GMM is rarely researched. 
- This paper demostrates an improved GMM with built-in DTW, without dimension explosion.
